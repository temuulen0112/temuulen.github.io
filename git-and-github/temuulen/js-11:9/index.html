        <p>When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. </p>
